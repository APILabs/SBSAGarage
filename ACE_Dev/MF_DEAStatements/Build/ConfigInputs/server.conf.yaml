ServerCredentials:
  # Optionally define credentials for use by the Integration Server.
  # Customize the CredentialType section for each type of credential that you want to create credentials for.
  # You must define each CredentialType at most once.
  # Each CredentialName must be unique within the CredentialType.
  # Each CredentialType has a set of allowable properties which are a subset of username, password, passphrase, apiKey, clientId, clientSecret, sshIdentityFile.
  # For full details of allowed CredentialTypes and their properties, refer to the Knowledge Center.
